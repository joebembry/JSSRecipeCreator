### 0.0.2 (December 18, 2014) Stomper

CHANGES:
- No uses AutoPkg configuration file. Hopefully you already have this configured for JSSImporter use!
- Optional argument -r/--recipe_template allows you to use a different recipe template file.

FIXES:
- Now prompts for a NAME if one doesn't exist. It does not, sadly, suggest "ballin' dubstep" as a potential name.
